my firefox setup (really basic)

If you are on linux
Make sure you have Git installed

VVV

- Go to your mozilla folder, (will probably be in the home directory called .mozzila)

- Go into firefox folder

- Go into your Firefox Profile Folder and type
```sh
git clone https://github.com/zxxtlz/firefox
```

Open the folder named "firefox" (the one you just cloned)

put "chrome" into your profile folder and do the same with "user.js"

If you are on Windows

VVV

- install the repo

- type in your firefox search bar about:profiles

- Make a new profile

- Look at where it says "Root Directory" press the button where it says open folder to the right.

- Open the folder you downloaded, and put "chrome" into your profile folder and do the same with "user.js"

# Plugins

Here are some plugins that make my life all that much better
- Undisposition // stops links from automatically downloading stuff, (example: whenever you click on a discord video link, it wont download but instead it will act as a normal video in your browser that you can watch)
- Clipboard2File // instead of having to download images, you can just place images from your clipboard
