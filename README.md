# firefox
my firefox setup (really basic)

If you are on linux
Make sure you have Git installed
VVV
Go to your mozilla folder, (will probably be in the home directory under .mozzila)
Go into firefox folder
Go into your Firefox Profile Folder and type "git clone https://github.com/zxxtlz/firefox" 
Open the folder named "firefox" (the one you just cloned)
put "chrome" into your profile folder and do the same with "user.js"

If you are on Windows
VVV
install the repo
type in your firefox search bar about:profiles
Make a new profile
Look at where it says "Root Directory" press the button where it says open folder to the right.
Open the folder you downloaded, and put "chrome" into your profile folder and do the same with "user.js"
