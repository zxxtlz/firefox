my firefox setup (really basic)

If you are on linux
Make sure you have Git installed

VVV

- Go to your mozilla folder, (will probably be in the home directory called .mozzila)

- Go into firefox folder

- Go into your Firefox Profile Folder and type
```sh
git clone https://github.com/zxxtlz/firefox
```

Open the folder named "firefox" (the one you just cloned)

put "chrome" into your profile folder and do the same with "user.js"
